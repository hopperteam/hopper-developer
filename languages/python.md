# Python specific instructions
## Installation
You can install the library with `pip`:
```
pip install hopper_api
```

## Differences
Python uses `snake_case` instead of `CamelCase` or `camelCase` for must function names. The Python library uses `snake_case` for function names to fit well into Python programs, which differentiates it from other language's libraries.

## Exceptions
The library uses `ConnectionError`s as exceptions. Make sure to catch them!
